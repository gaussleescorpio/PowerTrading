Powertrading project is a public open-source project aims to build up machine learning trading algorithm engine. It will be mainly in C++
and Python.

The development Steps are as follows:

1. Data handler origin for standard csv files. 
2. Backtesting engine with automatic PnL generation and ML model evaluation reports.
3. Strategy engine origin (one stratgy version).
4. Standard ML pipelines used in algotrading.

MVP finished!

4. Real-time data handler and database buildup.
